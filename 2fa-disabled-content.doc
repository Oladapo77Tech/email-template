Two-Factor Authentication Disabled For Your Crowd77 Account

Hi User,

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) has been disabled for your Crowd77 account. Your account security level has been reduced. This means your account is now only protected by your password. You no longer need an authenticator app to sign in.

We Recommend Enabling 2FA

Two-Factor Authentication significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to your account. We strongly encourage you to turn it back on to keep your account and funds secure.

Enable Two-Factor Authentication

If you did not disable Two-Factor Authentication, your account may be compromised. Please contact our support team immediately at support@crowd77.com and change your password right away.

Best regards,
The Crowd77 Team
